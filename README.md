# PyPSeis
A python and C++ package for passive seismic forward modelling, event detection and source location, including functions such as microseismic acquisition designing, synthetic seismogram generating, etc.

# User Manual
Use python codes array_generator.py to generate microseismic acquisiton geometries such as star array, grid array and patch array, etc. and export geophone coordinates into .dat file in specific format
Use C++ codes to read .dat files that python codes generated and generate correspond synthetic microseismic dataset
Use python codes datreader.py to read synthetic microseismic data and display microseismic event waveforms
